## Testing the Example Application

After completing the setup, you should verify that the application works correctly end-to-end.

### Local Test (Development)

1. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

2. Start the Flask development server:
```bash
flask run --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5000
```

3. Open your browser and visit:
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/write-test

The second route confirms that the application has permission to write files to the `static/images` directory.

### Production Test (Gunicorn)

1. Start the application using Gunicorn:
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 wsgi:app
```

2. Test again in the browser:
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/write-test

3. If Nginx is configured correctly, the application should also be reachable through your domain name.

### What to Check if Something Fails

- File permission errors usually indicate incorrect ownership or mode on the `static/` directory.
- Connection errors may indicate missing environment variables or incorrect PostgreSQL credentials.
- Always check logs for Flask, Gunicorn, Nginx, and PostgreSQL.
